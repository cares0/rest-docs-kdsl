# REST Docs KDSL

## Overview
This library provides a Kotlin DSL to simplify and enhance 
the readability of code used for documenting APIs with Spring REST Docs.

Using [KSP](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/ksp-overview.html), the library analyzes Spring handlers at compile time 
and generates DSL classes for each handler. 
These generated DSL classes allow you to write Spring REST Docs test code 
and generate adoc files for each API.
